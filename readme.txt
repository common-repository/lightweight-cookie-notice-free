This is the free version of Lightweight Cookie Notice, the lightweight and customizable cookie plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==
This is the free version of [Lightweight Cookie Notice](https://daext.com/lightweight-cookie-notice/), the lightweight and customizable cookie plugin for WordPress.

### A high-performance Cookie Plugin
This plugin generates the cookie notice with a single 9kb file (gzipped) written in pure JavaScript.

We recommend this plugin for high-performance websites or websites with a high number of visits.

### 83 Style Options
With the style options available in the plugin settings, you can customize the typography, the colors of all the elements, or even control details like borders, drop shadows, opacities, and more.

With all these options, you can create a cookie notice consistent with the style of your website.

### Works with all the caching plugins
This plugin verifies the cookie acceptance with JavaScript. For this reason, all the caching plugins (E.g. WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache, WP Fastest Cache) are supported.

### Geolocation
Display the cookie notice only to the users located in a custom-defined list of countries with the geolocation feature included in the plugin.

The plugin currently integrates two alternative geolocation services. The instructions to set up these services are available in the [geolocation section](https://daext.com/doc/lightweight-cookie-notice/#geolocation) of the plugin manual.

#### MaxMind GeoLite2
To enable the [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) geolocation service, create a [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) account, download the provided databases, and configure the paths to these files in the plugin settings.

#### HostIP.info

In this case, the IP geolocation data are retrieved with HTTP requests to the [HostIP.info](https://hostip.info/) website. This geolocation service doesn't require the creation of an account.

### Additional Features of This Cookie Plugin

#### Place the Cookie Notice in Multiple Positions
A selector available in the plugin options allows you to generate a cookie notice in the following position:

* Top of the screen
* In the middle of the screen
* Bottom of the screen

#### Shake Effect
Bring attention to the cookie notice with an optional shake effect applied to the cookie notice. The shake effect is activated when the user clicks outside the cookie notice.

#### Mask
This cookie plugin optionally generates a transparent mask over the content of the page. This mask makes the website unusable for the users that don't give their consent.

#### Responsive
The cookie notice generated by the plugin is fully responsive. We have also included the **Responsive Breakpoint** option to define when to switch from the desktop layout to the mobile layout and vice versa.

#### Additional information with a modal window
The plugin comes with an optional modal window that you can use to display the cookies policy, the privacy policy, or other custom information without redirecting the user to a specific page.

You can enter custom HTML in this modal window and easily include information like lists of cookies, lists of vendors, links to documents, and more.

#### Test Mode
Enable the **Test Mode** to display the cookie notice only to the website administrator. This feature allows you to set up the cookie notice content, colors, and behavior without causing temporary issues to a production website.

#### Custom Cookie Expiration
Set the amount of time you want to store the cookie acceptance of the user.

#### Reload Page
This option allows you to optionally reload the page when the user accept the cookies.

### Pro Version
With the [Professional Version](https://daext.com/lightweight-cookie-notice/) of this cookie plugin, you can:

* Download the consent log data in CSV format
* Download the proof of consent of each consent log record in PDF format
* Instantly run JavaScript scripts based on the cookie preferences of the user
